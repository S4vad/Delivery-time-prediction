## Delivery Time Prediction using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Django


# Introduction

Food Delivery services like Zomato and swiggy etc... <br>need to show the accurate time based on how
     much time<br> it wil take to deliver your order to keep transparency <br>with thir customers.
                    These companies<br> use Machine Learning algorithms to predict delivery time </p>

This is a project that utilizes Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to predict delivery times for a given set of parameters.
The project is implemented using Django, a powerful Python web framework,
to provide a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the delivery time prediction model.

# Requirements
To run this project, you need the following software installed on your system:

Python (>= 3.6).
Django (>= 3.0).
NumPy.
Pandas.
Scikit-learn.
TensorFlow (>= 2.0).

# Getting Started

Getting Started

1.Clone the repository:
  ```bash
https://github.com/S4vad/Delivery-time-prediction-ANN-Django.git
```

2.Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
```

# Acknowledgments
This project was inspired by the need for accurate delivery time predictions to improve logistics efficiency.
Special thanks to the contributors and maintainers of Django, TensorFlow, and NumPy for their fantastic open-source projects.
