## Delivery Time Prediction using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Django


# Introduction

Food Delivery services like Zomato and swiggy etc... <br>need to show the accurate time based on how
     much time<br> it wil take to deliver your order to keep transparency <br>with thir customers.
                    These companies<br> use Machine Learning algorithms to predict delivery time </p>

This is a project that utilizes Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to predict delivery times for a given set of parameters.
The project is implemented using Django, a powerful Python web framework,
to provide a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the delivery time prediction model.
